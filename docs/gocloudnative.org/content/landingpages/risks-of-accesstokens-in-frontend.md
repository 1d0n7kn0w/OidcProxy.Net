# The risks of Access Tokens in the Front-End

Access tokens play a crucial role in securing front-end applications by providing authorized access to protected resources. However, improper handling and management of access tokens can expose applications to significant security risks. This article explores the potential risks associated with access tokens in front-end development. We discuss common vulnerabilities, such as token leakage, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and token storage concerns. Additionally, we explore best practices to mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security posture of front-end applications.

Access tokens are vital for securing front-end applications and granting authorized access to protected resources. However, their mishandling can expose applications to security threats. This article delves into the risks associated with access tokens in front-end development and provides insights into mitigating these risks.

## Token Leakage
Improper handling of access tokens can lead to token leakage, where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's token. This can occur through various means, including network sniffing, client-side code vulnerabilities, and unintentional exposure in logs or error messages. Token leakage can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data and account hijacking.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:
Front-end applications are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into the application's code. If an attacker manages to inject a script that steals an access token, they can gain unauthorized access to protected resources. XSS vulnerabilities can arise from improper input sanitization and lack of output encoding in user-generated content.

## Insecure Token Storage
Front-end applications often store access tokens for subsequent API requests. If access tokens are not securely stored, they can be compromised through various means, such as local storage, session storage, or cookies. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting or cross-site request forgery to access and misuse these tokens.

## Best Practices for Mitigating Risks:
To mititage some of these risks, apply the following principles:

* __Migrate authentication to the server side__\
Create a dedicated Back-end for Front-end (BFF). Remove authentication from the Single-Page Application and move it to the BFF. This is called the BFF Security Pattern. Read how to implement it [here](https://bff.gocloudnative.org/integration-manuals/quickstarts/auth0/quickstart/)).

* __Employ Least Privilege Principle__\
Ensure that access tokens have the minimal required privileges to access specific resources. Follow the principle of least privilege to limit the potential impact if a token is compromised.

## Store Tokens Securely:
Choose secure storage mechanisms for access tokens, preferably on the server side. Use encrypted storage. 

## Conclusion
Access tokens are valuable assets in securing front-end applications, but their improper handling can lead to significant security risks. By understanding and mitigating these risks, developers can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of access tokens and enhance the overall security of their front-end applications. Implementing best practices and staying informed about emerging threats will go a long way in safeguarding user data and maintaining user trust.
